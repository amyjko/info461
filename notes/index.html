<h1>Chronological Notes from INFO 461, Offered Spring 2018</h1>

<h2>March 27, 2018 - Class 1.1</h2>

<p>The first class went really well. And the persistence lab was good, for the most part, too. </p>

<p>A few bugs:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>I didn't get the time of day right for the due date of the readings on Canvas. That confused the students. </li>
  <li>It was weird to say that thing to turn in for the main body of the reading isn't due until I ask a question about it in class, whereas the writeup about the additional reading is due before class.  Not bad, just weird. </li>
  <li>When I imported your Canvas file, I got only one 2pt assignment for Reading 1.1, rather than 2 1pt assignments (one for the in-class question and one for the additional reading). I left it that way, but realized it was weird last night.</li>
  <li>I didn't ask any in-class question for the first reading, since I didn't want to make them do homework before they even met me, but then I didn't want them to answer an unwritten question for what they turned in on Thursday. So I had them write the same summary for the in-class reading as they would for the additional reading.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the "additional" reading is referred to as a "selected" reading. That inconsistency of terminology confused the students. </li>
  <li>In the next iteration, I'd suggest to eliminate the single point in-class reading writeup for class #1. Just have them do the
  additional reading writeup due at the beginning of the next class along with the expected writeup of the additional reading for class 1.2.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Some observations about the Persistence lab being first with its javascript text-color changing code task:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Two design-focused students came up to me at the end to ask if coding was a significant part of the project. Could they get away with just doing design and let someone else do the coding? </li>
  <li>Two more students worried that since they hadn't done JS programming for at least a year, that they would do poorly in the course. They're worried that programming JS in class without any help is going to prove to be the rule, not an exception. </li>
</ol>
