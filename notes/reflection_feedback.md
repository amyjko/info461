#Summary of Students' End of Term/Project Reflections

Things that didn't go well:

* Balancing project with capstone
* Fraction of team was familiar with frameworks, resulting in heavy dependence on them for development
* Some team members not coming to class
* Didn't utilize documents created earlier in course (team member abandoned defined architecture, making it hard to provide help)
* Getting all teammembers to contribute
* Many teams used FB messenger instead of Slack b/c of familiarity, issues w/ Slack notifications (although some appreciated Slack)
* Trouble working remotely (in-person time was key)
* GitHub wiki was unfamiliar and "static," so many groups used Google docs
* Students who took CSE 154 as prereq were unfamiliar with frameworks, Git
* Nobody takes ownership of new issue
* Not all members tested code that was pushed
* rigid verification strategy slowed development
* setting up development envrionment on each member's computers

Things that went well:

* GitHub (branching strategy, issue tracking)
* Student continuing to contribute despite family emergency that required him to travel
* carefully designed specs, distributed responsibilities, open/established lines of communciation early on
* division of labor
* planning and design phases
* time in class for work/meet was critical
* psychological safety!
