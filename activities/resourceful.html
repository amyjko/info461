		<h1>Resourceful</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Great engineers ask for help when they need it, overcoming roadblocks with the resources of their team, their organization, and the world. They don't wait for help; they proactively pursue it.</p>
		
		<p>Does this already describe you? That's great! Today you get to hone your skills, reinforcing the importance of resourcefulness. If this doesn't describe you, today you reflect on what's holding you back. Is it fear? Is it a lack of knowledge?</p>
		
		<p>Part of being resourceful is <em>believing</em>&mdash;sometimes irrationally&mdash;that there is an answer and you can find it. Another part of resourcefulness is knowing where to look for help: will the web have the answer or should you ask an expert or a book? Finally, being resourceful also means knowing when the help you've found is helpful and when its not. That goes back to <a href="self-regulation.html">self-regulation</a>.</p>
		
		<p>To practice resourcefulness, I'm going to give you a particularly difficult feasibility assessment task that will stress your resourcefulness and you will practice 1) believing you can find an answer, 2) searching in the right place, and 3) being aware of when you're on track.</p>
		
		<p>Here's your task for the next 40 minutes:</p>
		
		<p><em>Is there a way to play the original game boy version of "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening" with a Nintendo Switch Joycon controller?</em></p>
		
		<p>Ten minutes before class, we'll discuss:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What was hard about this task?</li>
			<li>What strategies were most effective at answering this question?</li>
			<li>What effect did mindfulness have on your success at this task?</li>
		</ul>
