		<h1>Bug Bash</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew Begel</div>

		<h2>Goal</h2>

		<p>The goal of a bug bash is to break an application in as many different ways as possible. Keep careful attention to
		exactly <i>how</i> you break it, so that you can help the authors to know what they need to fix.</p>

		<h2>Find a Partner</h2>

		<p>Choose a person who works on a different team. Sit together at two computers in the lab.</p>

		<h2>Try their Project (10 min)</h2>

		<p>Ask your partner to show you how to setup and use their project. Run through the main project scenario with your
		partner. Ask your partner to pull up the project's Slack channel on your computer.<p>

		<h2>Break the Project (15 min)</h2>

		<p>Now, try using your partner's project without any guidance or help. Click and tap on anything you want. If the
		application behaves incorrectly (in your opinion) or does not do what you expected, explain the problem to your
		partner. Your partner should take a note of the problem in their team's Slack channel. Then, look for more bugs!</p>

		<h2>Find a New Partner</h2>

		<p>Choose another person who works on a different team. Sit together at two computers in the lab.</p>

		<h2>Try their Project (10 min)</h2>

		<p>Ask your partner to show you how to setup and use their project. Run through the main project scenario with your
		partner. Ask your partner to pull up the project's Slack channel on your computer. Both members of the pair should do this.<p>

		<h2>Break the Project (15 min)</h2>

		<p>Now, try using your partner's project without any guidance or help. Click and tap on anything you want. Both members of the pair should do this. If the
		application behaves incorrectly (in your opinion) or does not do what you expected, explain the problem to your
		partner. Your partner should take a note of the problem in their team's Slack channel. Then, look for more bugs!</p>
		
		<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

		<p>Attendance will be taken at the end of the lab. If you are still testing your partner's application, you
		will receive 1 point.</p>
