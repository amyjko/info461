		<h1>Persistant</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Some tasks take time. Some tasks take significant learning. When software engineering gets really hard, it's easy to give up, change a requirement, or abandon an approach because you're not sure how to proceed. In many cases this makes sense, because something truly is intractable, infeasible, or impossible, but in many other cases, it's just a lack of <em>persistence</em>.</p>
		
		<p>The best way to <em>learn</em> persistence is to be <em>resourceful</em>. Resourcefulness means responding with difficulties by reaching out for help, either by seeking information (online or from a person) or by seeking insight (more often from a person). To practice this, each of you will do one of two things today:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Explain something you're stuck on and secure help from one of your teammates (either in class or later).</li>
			<li>Explain something that you <em>were</em> stuck on and how you persisted.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>If you tell a story of persistence, it can feel like bragging to demonstrate your persistence. Remember that you're helping your teammates see what persistence looks like, helping them model that good behavior.</p>
