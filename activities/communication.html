		<h1>Setup communication</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Today you're going to set up the communication channels necessary for productive exchange. You're going to use <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> for most of your communication. If you haven't used Slack before, it's basically a one or more chat rooms in which you can write text and share images and documents. (Technologies like this have been around since the early 1980's; apparently it took 40 years for them to become worth <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/04/01/slack-raises-200-million-at-3-8-billion-valuation/" target="_blank">more than a billion dollars</a>).</p>
		
		<h2>Create a Slack Team</h2>
		
		<p>Rather than having one big monolithic Slack team for the class, you're each going to have your own Slack team. This will ensure you have some privacy, but it will also allow you to completely customize your channel to your team's needs.</p>
		
		<p>Do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Choose a team logo (so you can distinguish it from your other teams)</li>
			<li>Ensure everyone is invited</li>
			<li>Make sure everyone has installed the Slack desktop/mobile apps</li>
			<li>Setup notifications (especially on mobile) so you know when someone is trying to reach you and your team.</li>
			<li>Create any channels that you already know will be necessary for your team, writing a clear purpose for each</li>
			<li>Setup any integrations you might want with Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, etc. to streamline communication</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Create a shared Google Hangout</h2>
			
		<p>To facilitate synchronous remote meetings, create a shared <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Hangout</a>. Integrate this into your Slack team so that you can easily start a Hangout from Slack.</p>
		
		<h2>Define communication policies</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What are your team's expectations about timeliness of replies? Immediately? Within the hour? By the end of the day?</li>
			<li>When should you use @channel to <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement" target="_blank">make an announcement on Slack?</a></li>
			<li>When someone asks a question, who should reply? The "right" person or everyone?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Write all of these down in a new document on your GitHub wiki so everyone is clear on expectations.</p>

		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>For credit, send an invite to your Slack team to your instructor and TA (emails found on <a href="../index.html">course homepage</a>).</p>
