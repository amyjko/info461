		<h1>Setup communication</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Today you're going to set up the communication channels necessary for productive exchange. You're going to use <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> for most of your communication. If you haven't used Slack before, it's basically a one or more chat rooms in which you can write text and share images and documents. (Technologies like this have been around since the early 1980's; apparently it took 40 years for them to become worth <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/04/01/slack-raises-200-million-at-3-8-billion-valuation/" target="_blank">more than a billion dollars</a>).</p>
		
		<h2>Join the class Slack Team</h2>
		
		<p>If you haven't already, respond to the invite to the team. </p>
		
		<p>Do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Create one or more channels for your team's communication, preferably using your team's name.</li>
			<li>Ensure everyone on your team is invited to the channel(s).</li>
			<li>Make sure everyone has installed the Slack desktop/mobile apps</li>
			<li>Setup push notifications (especially on mobile) on your channels so you know when someone is trying to reach you and your team.</li>
			<li>Request the instructor or TA to add any integrations you might want with Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, etc. to streamline communication.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Create a shared Google Hangout</h2>
			
		<p>To facilitate synchronous remote meetings, create a shared <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Hangout</a>. Integrate this into your Slack team so that you can easily start a Hangout from Slack.</p>
		
		<h2>Define communication policies</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What are your team's expectations about timeliness of replies? Immediately? Within the hour? By the end of the day?</li>
			<li>When should you use @channel to <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement" target="_blank">make an announcement on Slack?</a></li>
			<li>When someone asks a question, who should reply? The "right" person or everyone?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Write all of these down in a new document on your GitHub wiki so everyone is clear on expectations.</p>

		<h2>Schedule team meetings</h2>

		<p>Meetings are fantastic forcing functions to help you get work done because they serve as social deadlines. Peer pressure
		is a powerful motivator. Your team should use that to its advantage.</p>

		<p>Coordinate among yourselves to choose a time and place to meet once per week. In the syllabus, you will find that many
		class sessions, especially those further towards the end of the quarter, have been designated as "work time." These are
		excellent times to hold team meetings since you will all be in the same place at the same time. In the earlier weeks of the
		class, you may have to work harder to set up your meetings.</p>

		<p>Write down the schedule for every team meeting in a document on your GitHub wiki so everyone knows when and where to
		meet.</p>

		<h2>Plan the agenda for each meeting</h2>
		
		<p>The team manager should come to the team meeting with a prepared agenda. This helps make sure that the meeting time is
		spent accomplishing your team's goals rather than simply sharing funny memes you saw on social media. A <b>great</b> manager
		will share the agenda at least one day prior to the team meeting to ensure that all team members know in advance what is
		expected of them. </p>

		<p>The first item on every week's agenda should have the manager publicly acknowledge every team member's individual accomplishments
		from the past week. If team members want to discuss something, they may write to the manager prior to the meeting to have it
		placed on the agenda. However, new items can be added to the meeting agenda any time during the meeting as well.</p>

		<p>One team member should be responsible for taking notes at the team meeting. Be sure to write down the names of everyone who
		attended. In the notes, for each item on the agenda, write down the agenda item, a summary of the discussion about that item,
		and any accomplishments, problems, and TODO items the team came up with during that item's discussion. After each meeting, upload
		the meeting notes to your GitHub wiki.</p>

		
		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>For credit, invite the instructor to your channel and write a message to them mentioning their name using the "@" syntax.</p>
