		<h1>Builds</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew Begel</div>

		<p>If you're building anything more than just a static web page, build automation can be key to accelerating the development cycle of edit, run, debug. In today's activity, determine the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Do you need to build?</li>
			<li>If so, what do you need to build?</li>
			<li>Will a simple <code>npm</code> build script work or do you need something more sophisticated?</li>
			<li>Will you adopt a continuous integration tool like <a href="codeship.com">CodeShip</a> to streamline testing and releases?</li>
			<li>How will you integrate tests into your builds?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The simplest of build scripts can still have a lot of complexity. For example, here's an <code>npm</code>
		<code>package.json</code> file that Andy Ko uses to build his <a href="http://faculty.uw.edu/ajko">faculty web site</a> which uses React and a variety of other dependencies:</p>
		
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
	"name": "UWFacultyPage",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"scripts": {
	    "build": "browserify -t [ babelify --presets [ react ] ] src/app.js | uglifyjs > build/app.js",
	    "watch": "watch 'npm run build' src"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"babel-cli": "^6.0.0",
		"babel-preset-es2015": "^6.3.13",
		"browserify": "latest",
		"watch": "latest"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		"babel-preset-react": "^6.5.0",
		"babelify": "^7.2.0",
		"react": "^0.14.0",
		"react-dom": "^0.14.0",
		"react-router": "^2.0.0",
		"history": "latest",
		"jquery": "^1.12.0",
		"bootstrap": "^3.3.6",
		"lodash": "latest",
		"uglify-js": "latest"
	}
}
</pre>

	<p>When we execute <code>npm run build</code>, <code>npm</code> executes the command that we've named "build" above, which runs
	<code>browserify</code>. This is an <code>npm</code> package that first converts all of the JSX files in my source directly into
	JavaScript, then compiles all of the JavaScript files in all of those big source files into a single monolithic JavaScript source
	file, and then pipes that big file into <code>uglifyjs</code>, which minifies the big monolithic JavaScript file, shrinking variable
	names and removing unnecessary whitespace. All of this means that we only have to have a single JavaScript import in the main HTML
	file, and it's small, which accelerates page load.</p>
	
	<p>Also note the <code>watch</code> command. It uses a command line utility called <code>watch</code> to run a build every time we
	edit a file in the <code>src</code> folder, so we always have a fresh build for manual testing.</p>
	
	<p>You might not want or need all of the things above. You might also want more. What you do depends on the plans you've devised for coordination and testing.</p>
