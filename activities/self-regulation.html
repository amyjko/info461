		<h1>Self-regulation</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>There are a lot of things that software engineers have to be good at. One of the most central, however, is <em>being aware of their thinking</em>. This awareness, which psychologists call <b>self-regulation</b>, is at the heart of almost everything a software engineer does:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Making good decisions requires being aware of your biases and the limitations on your knowledge.</li>
			<li>Collaborating with other people requires being aware of your communication strengths and weaknesses.</li>
			<li>Designing and debugging code requires being aware of your strategies and whether they're working.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>More than just awareness, however, good self-regulation involves actively <em>controlling</em> your thinking, monitoring your thinking and intervening when you believe it's not effective.</p>
		
		<p>How are you supposed to learn these skills? The central way is to practice being aware. In <a target="_blank" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858252">a study from my lab</a>, we found that simply prompting developers to reflect regularly promoted greater self-regulation skills, which translated into higher productivity.</p>
		
		<h2>Your task</h2>

		<p>To practice self regulation, I want you to engage in a difficult task (like programming), so your mind is occupied. Today, your task will be to write a JavaScript function that finds <b>all of the text on a page and turns it a random color that is high enough contrast with the page background to be legible</b>. You don't need a lot of tools to do this; just a web browser to find documentation, a text editor to write your functions, and a few pages to test it on. The point of this exercise isn't to actually finish the task (it's actually really hard), but to develop your self-regulation skills.</p>
		
		<p>For today, you're going to work alone.</p>
		
		<h2>My prompting</h2>
		
		<p>Every time I prompt you, turn to your neighbor and answer the following questions:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What are you doing?</li>
			<li>Why are you doing it?</li>
			<li>Is it working?</li>
			<li>If not, what should you do differently?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Work (30 min)</h2>
		
		<p>You work, I'll prompt.</p>
		
		<h2>Reflect (5 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Discuss in groups of four:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Did monitoring your work improve your productivity?</li>
			<li>Did you find yourself monitoring your work without prompting?</li>
			<li>What was hard about monitoring your work?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>After discussing in groups, we'll discuss as a class.</p>
