		<h1>Context</h1>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Many students will be doing capstone projects that also involve software engineering teamwork. They will be struggling to balance their efforts in both projects.</li>
			<li>At the end of the quarter, many students will not come to class. In some cases, this was the right choice, because it allowed students to work when and where they would be most optimal. In other cases, the lack of incentive to come to class led to suboptimal teamwork, and some students viewed it as my responsibility to make them come via my authority.</li>
			<li>From the students' perspectives, in-person meeting time was essential to success. Using the scheduled class time to incentivize this time was critical.</li>
			<li>Students found that the class did a great job promoting carefully designed specifications, explicitly distributed responsibilities, psychological safety, and open lines of communication early on.</li>
