# INFO 461 Teaching Guide

## Pre-quarter action items

* Copy the previous year's Canvas
* Update the Canvas due dates
* Update the syllabus link on the Canvas web page
* Update the schedule on the course website
* Update all HTML tagged with the word "QUARTERLY"
* Create a Slack team for the class
* Create a #questions channel for questions
* Invite all students to the Slack team

## Student context to be aware of

* Many students will be doing capstone projects that also involve software engineering teamwork. They will be struggling to balance their efforts in both projects.
* At the end of the quarter, many students didn't come to class. In some cases, this was the right choice, because it allowed students to work when and where they would be most optimal. In other cases, the lack of incentive to come to class led to suboptimal teamwork, and some students viewed it as my responsibility to make them come via my authority.
* Many teams used FB messenger instead of Slack because of familiarity and poorly configured Slack notifications. Many teams, however did appreciate Slack.
* From the students' perspectives, in-person meeting time was essential to success. Using the scheduled class time to incentivize this time was critical.
* Students found that the class did a great job promoting carefully designed specifications, explicitly distributed responsibilities, psychological safety, and open lines of communication early on.

## Problems caused by the course design

* Need to incorporate time and expectation for students to learn APIs and frameworks. This was hidden learning in the class, and surfacing it as explicit and expected and part of class would help reduce the pressure on teammates who were the only ones with the necessary knowledge.
* Some teams didn't utilize the architecture documents they created earlier in course. In some cases, this was reasonable, since they were first drafts and really first attempts at thinking about architecture. In other cases, it was problematic, since teammates relied on those documents to understand the code, but the architecture in the documents was abandoned.
* Many teams found GitHub's wiki unfamiliar to too difficult to edit, so teams relied on Google Docs instead. This created extra work, because we needed the wiki and it's history to grade, forcing the students to duplicate effort.
* Some students used CSE 154 as their web development pre-requisite, which didn't prepare them with any version control or web development framework knowledge.
* Setting up development environments on each students' computer was painful, slow, and unsupported by the class.
* Students craved more non-academic reading options.
* The paper midterm took too long to grade. Devise a way to run an online version in class while still preventing cheating.

## Problems intrinsic to software engineering
* Students struggled to define ownership over issue triage.
* Students struggled to define good testing practices.
* Students were frustrated by how much verification slowed development
* As with any team, many teams had trouble getting particular teammates to contribute.
