		<h1>Release</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>In just over three weeks, you're going to launch your 1.0 product. Excited? Daunted? I hope both! If you've done a good job preparing for your implementation phase, there are several things that should make your process smooth and uneventful:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>You should know what components you need to build and who is building them.</li>
			<li>You should know how you're going to test your product.</li>
			<li>You should know how you're going to coordinate and communicate over the next few weeks.</li>
			<li>You should know what technologies, APIs, platforms, and languages you're going to use.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>If each of you is putting a solid 10 hours per week of implementation time, plus 5 hours of in-class coordination and planning time, you should have plenty of time to reach this deadline.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
		
		<p>A successful launch gets <strong>10 points</strong>. To determine a "successful" launch, we'll consider two factors: how many of your planned requirements you met and how well you correctly implemented your planned requirements.</p>
		
		<p>To evaluate how many of your planned requirements you met, you'll annotate all of the requirements in your GitHub wiki as either <code>complete</code> or <code>incomplete</code>. We'll count the proportion of your planned requirements that are complete and multiple it by <strong>10</strong>, rounding to the nearest integer. We will verify each requirement tagged <code>complete</code>.</p>
		
		<p>Then, in <a href="evaluate.html">Homework 8</a>, all of your classmates are going to try your software, using it for the tasks its intended for. For every bug they find, they'll submit an issue to your repository and rate it's severity on this scale:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Major</strong>. Functionality cannot be used to accomplish the intended task.</li>
			<li><strong>Minor</strong>. Functionality can be used to accomplish the intended task, but requires a workaround to be used successfully.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For every <strong>Major</strong> issue, you'll lose <strong>1 point</strong> and for every <strong>Minor</strong> issue, you'll lose <strong>0.5 points</strong>. Note that if you have a large number of issues of any kind, it's possible to submit a mostly working application that receives zero points. That means that comprehensive testing is paramount!</p>
		
		<p>You'll need to make sure your repository is accessible to anyone so they can submit issues. You'll also need to create labels that match the scale above so your classmates can submit issues with those labels.</p>
		
		<p>Remember that GitHub tracks history on everything, including changes to wiki pages and changes to issues. We'll be using that history to determine grades. Feel free to make whatever changes you like to issues and your wiki. We'll inspect the history of these changes to determine grades.</p>
