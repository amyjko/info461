		<h1>Homework 3: Requirements</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>By now you should have a detailed specification of your design, detailing every visual and interactive detail of your solution to the problem you selected. Your next task is to translate this into a set of requirements, each expressed in natural language. Each of your projects will have a different number of requirements, so I can't say how long your list will be. I wouldn't be surprised if there are hundreds.</p>

		<p>Create a requirements document in your repository. To make the requirements easier to navigate and understand, organize your requirements into sections, each describing a set of related requirements. Each section should be linked to a part of your design specification, when appropriate. Each requirement should be <em>precise</em>, <em>testable</em>, and <em>non-conflicting</em>. The set of requirements overall should be <em>complete</em>.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading criteria</h2>
			
		<p>For activity credit, show me or the TA your draft list of requirements.</p>
		<p>For homework credit, submit a link to your requirements document in your public repository in Canvas.</p>

		<p>To incentivize you to be thorough in your requirements, your classmates will grade your requirements according to this scale:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Precision</b>. Every requirement that could have been phrased unambiguously but was not loses <b>0.25 points</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Testability</b>. Every requirement that cannot be tested or verified loses <b>0.25 points</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Conflicts</b>. Every pair of conflicting requirements loses <b>0.25 points</b>.</li>
			<li><b>Completeness</b>. Every requirement the reader can think of that was not included loses <b>0.25 points</b>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Note that in this grading scale, it's <em>really</em> easy to get a zero if you don't think really carefully about every detail. Scour your design specification for every little detail, generating as many requirements as you can, and then generate even more. Remember that the more detailed you can get, the better your engineering to do list for later! Save yourself the future effort of generating these lists by doing a thorough job now, which will help you plan.</p>
