		<h1>Homework 5: Process</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Every project needs its own custom process to proceed. In this homework, you'll devise your process and build out the tools and infrastructure you need to implement your process. To drive your process design, write a GitHub wiki page that answers the following questions:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? Describe specific tools or settings.</li>
			<li>What coordination and planning practices will you follow? Identify daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, ad hoc meetings, or other ways of coordinating work.</li>
			<li>By what date will you have a fully-built (but likely buggy) release candidate?</li>
			<li>What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?</li>
			<li>What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For each answer you provide, write a justification that explains how your answer is the best answer, given what you know about what you need to build.</p>

		<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

		<p>Submit a GitHub link to Canvas for credit.</p>

		<p>A good process is consistent with reality. You'll get a full <b>4 points</b> if the process you describe and the rationale you provide is logical and accounts for the reality of your schedules, availability, and time. For every part of your process that seems either arbitrary or unnecessary, you will lose <b>0.25 points</b>. To make sure that your proposed process doesn't have these elements, test your process: try the tools and practices you're proposing on your homework assignment and see how well they work together.</p>
