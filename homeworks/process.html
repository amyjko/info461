		<h1>Homework 5: Process</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew Begel</div>

		<p>Every project needs its own custom process to proceed because every software project has unique technical dependencies. In this homework, you'll devise your process and build out the tools and infrastructure you need to implement your process. To drive your process design, write a GitHub wiki page that answers the following questions:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? Describe specific tools or settings.</li>
			<li>What coordination and planning practices will you follow? Identify daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, ad hoc meetings, or other ways of coordinating work.</li>
			<li>Who will own each of the components in your architecture?</li>
			<li>By what date will you have a fully-built (but likely buggy) release candidate?</li>
			<li>What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?</li>
			<li>What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For each answer you provide, <strong>write a justification</strong> that explains how your answer is the best answer, given what you know about what you need to build. I want to incentivize you to think deeply about each of these choices, to make sure your process decision actually makes sense. (Who wants to do things that don't make sense?)</p>

		<p>All this said, your answers above are a prototype. Expect your process to change. Plan for it to change.</p>

		<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

		<p>Submit a GitHub link to Canvas for credit.</p>

		<p>A good process is consistent with reality. You'll get a full <b>4 points</b> if you 1) answer all of the questions above and 2) the answers you provide are account for the reality of your schedules, availability, and time. For every part of your process that seems either arbitrary or unnecessary, you will lose <b>0.25 points</b>. To make sure that your proposed process doesn't have these elements, be explicit not just about <em>who</em> is doing what but <em>why</em> they are the right choice and why they have sufficient time, expertise, and resources to do it. Being explicit will help me assess how rational your decisions are, but more importantly, it will help <em>you</em> be more rational about your decisions.</p>
