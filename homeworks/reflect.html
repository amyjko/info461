		<h1>Homework 10 - Reflect</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew Begel</div>

		<p>Individually, write a roughly <strong>500 word statement</strong> covering the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What worked well about your team's process?</li>
			<li>What did not work well about your team's process?</li>
			<li>What tasks and activities did you do well?</li>
			<li>What tasks and activities did you do poorly?</li>
			<li>Which person on your team deserves the MVP (Most Valuable Player) award? The winner should epitomize the
			following essential qualities: self-regulating, open-minded, facile with complexity, tradeoff-aware, honest,
			resourceful, adaptive, vulnerable, and persistent. Pick two of these qualities and for each, recount an event that convinced
			you that the winner exhibited the quality.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You'll submit this report on <a href="http://canvas.uw.edu">Canvas</a>.</p>

		<h2>Grading criteria</h2>
		
		<p>Covering the five topics above is enough for the full <strong>2 points</strong>. If you don't cover all of the criteria
		above, we'll give partial credit proportional to what you cover. Because of the short timeline to write this reflection, we
		will not evaluate the quality of your writing, just its content. (That said, your work should be clear enough to be understood).</p>
			
		<p>If we receive consistent reports from your teammates that you do not deserve full credit for your team's success, we will
		use our discretion to award you only a portion of the project grade consistent with those reports.</p>
