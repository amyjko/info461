		<h1>Reflect</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Individually, write a roughly <strong>500 word statement</strong> covering the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What worked well about your team's process?</li>
			<li>What didn't work well about your team's process?</li>
			<li>What did you do well?</li>
			<li>What did you not do well?</li>
			<li>Do you believe any of your teammates do not deserve full credit for your team's success? Why? What percent of the credit do you think they deserve?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You'll submit this report on <a href="http://canvas.uw.edu">Canvas</a>.</p>

		<h2>Grading criteria</h2>
		
		<p>Covering the five topics above is enough for the full <strong>2 points</strong>. If you don't cover all of the above, we'll give partial credit proportional to what you cover. Because of the short timeline to write this reflection, we won't be evaluating the quality of your writing, just it's content. (That said, it has to be clear enough that we know what you meant to say).</p>
			
		<p>If we receive consistent reports from your teammates that you do not deserve full credit for your team's success, we will use our discretion to give you only a portion of the full project points consistent with your teammate's reports.</p>
