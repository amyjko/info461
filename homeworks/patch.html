		<h1>Homework 9 - Patch</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Now that you have a set of issues reported by your classmates, your job is to triage and repair them, releasing a patch. For each defect:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Decide whether the issue is a real failure, a duplicate of another reported issue, or not a real failure.</li>
			<li>Write comments indicating your decision for each, closing the duplicates and non-failures.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Because you don't have much time to repair these issues, prioritize the real failures, you can do one of two things for each real failure:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Reproduce, localize, and fix the defect causing the failure by the second release deadline.</li>
			<li>Write a detailed rationale as an issue comment for why the defect cannot be fixed before the deadline.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Grading criteria</h2>
		
		<p>Your points will be calculated as the percent of adequately addressed issues, scaled to 2 points. "Adequate" here is defined as either correctly repaired defects or a detailed justification for why it is impossible to fix the defect before the second launch deadline.</p>
		
		<p>Convincing rationales demonstrate impossibility; <strong>appealing to not having enough time is not enough</strong>. Show that you've analyzed the fix required to a degree that you know how much work would be required, but that work is not feasible within the remaining time.</p>
