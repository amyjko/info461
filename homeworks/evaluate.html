		<h1>Homework 8 - Evaluate</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>Now that every team has launched, it's time to find out whether these applications are functionally correct. Your job in this homework is to <strong>find failures</strong> in all of your classmates' applications (but not yours, obviously). You'll follow the scale as described in the <a href="release.html">Release homework</a>:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Major</strong>. Functionality cannot be used to accomplish the intended task.</li>
			<li><strong>Minor</strong>. Functionality can be used to accomplish the intended task, but requires a workaround to be used successfully.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You can find the application URLs listed on the main page of the course website. For each one, use the application, trying all of it's major features, filing bugs <strong>in the team's GitHub repository "Issues" page</strong> for each problem you find, marking their severity with the labels above. Expect to spend at least <b>10</b> minutes with each application, for a total of roughly <b>1 hour</b> of testing.</p>

		<p>Note that you can fix defects as soon as they're reported; you don't have to wait until after the evaluation period. Be on hand to triage, diagnose, and repair to minimize the potential for other major defects being reported.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading criteria</h2>
		
		<p>This homework is worth <strong>2 points</strong>. You'll get <strong>one point</strong> for filing at least one issue on at least one application. You'll get <strong>another point</strong> if that issue contains detailed, unambiguous reproduction steps.</p>
		'
		<p>To get this credit, submit a link to the GitHub issue you believe represents your best report.</p>
